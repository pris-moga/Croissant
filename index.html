    <p>
      A croissant is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry of Austrian origin,
      but mostly associated with France. Croissants are named for their
      historical crescent shape and, like other viennoiseries, are made of a
      layered yeast-leavened dough. The dough is layered with butter, rolled and
      folded several times in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a
      technique called laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky
      texture, similar to a puff pastry.
